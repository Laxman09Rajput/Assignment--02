        "1. What are data structures, and why are they important ?\n",
        " -  A data structure is a method for organizing and storing data efficiently.  It facilitates easy access, editing, and management of data.  Types of data structures:  Linear data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues (data that is ordered).  Trees and graphs are examples of non-linear data structures.  Hashing: Hash Tables (key-value storage for quick searches).  Why Are They Important?  Improve the pace and efficiency of processes.  Optimize memory use.  Solve complicated issues efficiently.  Essential in software, databases, artificial intelligence, and networking.  Choosing the appropriate data structure improves computing performance and scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples ?\n",
        "  - Mutable means \"changeable,\" but immutable means \"unchangeable\" after creation. That's the straightforward distinction. Types of Mutable Data (Can Be Changed) Consider a movable item, such as a whiteboard. Without having to replace the entire board, you can write anything, erase it, and then write it again. Data types that are immutable (cannot be changed) Similar to a printed book, an immutable object cannot have its words altered without creating a new duplicate.When you need to update data often, mutable types are ideal. Because they guard against unintentional changes and facilitate debugging, immutable types are safer.\n",

        "3.What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - A list functions similarly to a notepad, allowing you to write, remove, and add items at any moment. Because it's adaptable, you can add, remove, or modify anything as needed. Lists are useful when you need to update your data often.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - A printed book is analogous to a tuple. You cannot alter anything inside of it after it has been created. Although you can read it, you are unable to edit or remove anything. When data needs to be fixed, such as the days of the week, tuples come in handy.\n",
        "\n",
        " 4.Describe how dictionaries store data.\n",
        "\n",
        "     - Key-value pairs are used in dictionaries to store data.  The value is the data, and the key is similar to a label.  When a key is added, the dictionary locates a location in memory to store it using a hash function.  The same function is used when you look up a key in order to rapidly determine the value.  A collision occurs when two keys occupy the same space. The dictionary can handle this by storing several values in a list.  To keep things moving quickly, it resizes if it becomes too full.  This speeds up the search, addition, and deletion of material in dictionaries.\n",
        "\n",
        " 5.Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - In situations where you simply require unique values and don't care about order, use a set rather than a list.  Additionally, because sets employ a unique method of data storage, they are quicker to verify for items.  Sets also make it simple to identify whether objects are similar or distinct between two groups.  But a list is a preferable option if you have to allow duplicates or keep things organized\n",
        "\n",
        " 6.What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list  \n",
        "    - A string in Python is an unchangeable string of Unicode characters that is denoted by a single ('), double (\"), or triple (''' \"\"\") quotation.  Slicing, indexing, and other string manipulation techniques are supported.  \n",
        "\n",
        "     Any changeable sequence that contains elements of several data kinds is called a list.  Square brackets ([]) are used to define lists, which can be modified by adding or deleting items.\n",

        " 7.How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python ?  \n",
        "\n",
        "    - Since tuples can’t be changed after they’re created, they help keep data safe from accidental edits. That’s why they\"re great for storing things like database records, settings, or constants—anything that shouldn’t be modified by mistake.\n",
        "\n",
        " 8.What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "      - A hash table is a type of data structure that uses a technique known as hashing to map keys to values.  It makes data retrieval incredibly quick by converting each key into a unique index using a hash function.  Rather than going through each element, the hash table goes straight to the value's storage location.  Hash tables are used in Python to implement dictionaries.  Because of this, dictionary operations such as finding, adding, or removing values are very effective and usually take a constant amount of time (O(1)).  Dictionary hashing requires that its keys be immutable (such as strings, numbers, or tuples) in order to provide consistent hashing\n",
        "\n",
        " 9.Can lists contain different data types in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    -  Python lists are incredibly adaptable; they can at the same time contain items of several data kinds.  You can mix numbers, texts, booleans, and even other lists without any problems because each element in a list is essentially simply a reference to an item in memory.  One of Python's best features is its dynamic typing, which lets you work with a variety of data in a single convenient container\n",
        "\n",
        " 10.Explain why strings are immutable in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "    - In Python, strings can’t be changed once they’re created. If you try to modify one, Python actually makes a new string instead of altering the original. This design helps save memory, keeps dictionary keys stable, and prevents accidental bugs. So, while it might seem inconvenient at times, immutability actually makes Python more efficient and reliable  \n",

        "11.What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Python dictionaries are ideal for efficient data retrieval and storage organization.  With dictionaries, you can use keys to obtain values instantaneously, unlike lists where you have to search item by item.  Why they're frequently superior to lists is as follows:  1.  Faster lookups: Use a key instead of scanning the entire document.  2.  More readable: Compared to numbered indexes, keys convey information more easily.  3.  Improved structure — Relevant data remains organized and manageable.  4.  Efficient updates — Unlike lists, adding or removing things doesn't involve relocating elements.  These features make dictionaries ideal for counting words in a text, keeping track of goods, and preserving user profiles.  They speed up and simplify the handling of data\n",

        "\n",
        "   A birthdate is something that never changes, so it makes sense to store it in a tuple rather than a list. Tuples are immutable, meaning once you set the data, it stays the same and can’t be changed by mistake.\n",

        "    Example-\n",
        "\n",
        "        [birthdate = (2000, 7, 15)  # (Year, Month, Day)]\n",
        "\n",
        "If we used a list, there’s a chance someone could accidentally modify the birthdate, which wouldn’t make sense. But for things that do change—like an address or phone number—a list would be a better choice.\n",

        " 13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python ?\n",
        "     \n",
        "  - In Python, sets don’t mess around with duplicates. If you try to add the same value more than once, Python just shrugs and keeps only one of them. Simple as that.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "  See what happened? Even though 3 and 4 showed up twice, the set only kept one of each. That’s because sets use a special system under the hood (called a hash table) that automatically ignores duplicates.\n",

        " 14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries ?\n",
        "     \n",
        "     - Although they function differently, the in keyword determines if an item is present in a dictionary or list.  Python searches lists for matches by going through each item one at a time.  For lengthy lists, this could be slow.  Only the keys, not the values, are checked for dictionaries.  Python employs a hash table for rapid lookups, which makes it significantly faster.  You must look through each value individually if you need to check for a value.  Important Distinctions:  Lists: Performs slower item-by-item searches.  Dictionaries: Instantly (faster) check keys.  Search in.values() to locate a value in a dictionary.  When looking for existence, dictionaries are far faster, especially when dealing with big datasets!\n",

        " 15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not ?\n",
        "\n",
        "      - You cannot change the elements of tuples since they are immutable in Python.  Once formed, one cannot have elements added, changed, or removed.  The immutability of tuples makes them more efficient and helps shield data from accidental changes.  Python can also optimize their storage, which speeds up lookups.  Additionally, because tuples are hashable (provided they only contain immutable members), they can be used as dictionary keys or appended to sets.  However, if a tuple contains a changeable object (like a list), the item itself may change, but the tuple's structure stays the same\n",
        "\n",
        " 16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case ?\n",
        "     \n",
        "     -One dictionary inside another is called a nested dictionary.  It facilitates complex data organization by methodically integrating pertinent details.  When is it required to have a nested dictionary?  The arrangement and accessibility of information about many people, objects, or employees can be facilitated by a nested dictionary.  One vocabulary, for example, can be used to store student records instead of multiple dictionaries for things like grades and age.  Because all the data is kept neatly organized under one key, it is easier to manage and retrieve the data as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "        Example  -  employees = { \"John\": {\"role\": \"Manager\", \"salary\": 60000},\n",

        "     \n",
        "     -  \n",
        "      Python dictionaries make use of hash tables, which makes it very fast to access an element within one.  It usually takes O(1) time to look up a key, regardless of the dictionary's size.  Sometimes hash collisions cause too many keys to end up in the same place, slowing down the lookup time to O(n).  However, Python's hash table is designed to handle this efficiently, so it's not a common issue.  Because dictionary lookups are almost instantaneous, they are generally far faster than list searches\n",
        "\n",
        "  18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "     - Sometimes lists are a better option than dictionaries:  When sequence matters: Lists help you process things in a certain order by keeping items in the order you add them.  2. For basic data storage: Working with a list is simpler if you only need to save a collection of values without labeling them.  3. Quicker looping: Compared to a dictionary, it is typically faster and uses less memory to iterate through a list.  4. Position-based access: Lists allow you to retrieve items by index, which is useful when order matters.  The better choice is a list if all you need is a basic, well-organized collection of objects\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        " 19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval ?\n",
        "  - Unlike lists, which use index-based access, dictionaries require a key to retrieve a value; in Python 3.7 and later, dictionaries maintain insertion order, so items appear in the order they were added when iterated; however, their main focus is still efficient key-based access rather than strict ordering. While dictionaries are great for quick searches, they aren't ideal for index-based retrieval or sorting; if order is important, OrderedDict (for older Python versions) or lists of tuples may be better options. However, modern dictionaries are incredibly efficient for the majority of tasks.\n",

        " 20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n",
        "    \n",
        "   - A list is comparable to a row of lockers, each of which has a number.  You can quickly locate items based on their position if you know the number.  If not, you must check each one individually.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   - A dictionary resembles a series of cabinets with labels.  You simply look for the label rather than going through each one, which is significantly quicker. Dictionaries are hence excellent for fast lookups.  They occupy slightly more memory, though.  Use a list, then, if you need to keep items organized and retrieve them by position.  A dictionary is a preferable option if you want to get information fast by utilizing names rather than numbers.\n",
